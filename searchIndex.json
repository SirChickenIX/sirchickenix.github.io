This world sits in parallel to the one we all grew up in- all of the pagan gods, wild daydreams, and fantastic stories of myth and lore may have more merit that we all believed.\nDifferences\nAareth has two Australias. Also, the Roman Catholic Church recently schismed and became the Roman Catholic Church of Rome and the Roman Catholic Church of Madagascar.\nGeography\nLike earth but with two Australias. Scholars divide the world into four supercontinents: <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Afro-Eurasia</a>, The Americas, Oceania, and Antarctica. Within <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Afro-Eurasia</a> are the continents of Africa and <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Eurasia</a>, within The Americas are North America and South America, and withing Oceania are West Australia and East Australia. Antarctica is not divided by mainstream academia because it is largely uninhabited and unexplored. These supercontinent divisions are mostly geographic, and the main cultural divisions are between continents.\nHistory",
