Mostly inhabited and governed by shape-shifters, **Germany** is an unusual country but nevertheless one of greatest powers of [[Aareth/Places/Celestial Bodies/Aareth/Afro-Eurasia/Eurasia/Europe/Europe\|Europe]].

# History
For many centuries the Holy Roman Empire persecuted shape-shifters because they were feared and disliked by the general public. This empire set up Germany as a place to put all of the shape-shifters in their own, self-contained society where they couldn't hurt anyone because they couldn't leave. With the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, Germany became an immensely successful society- because of its self-governance during this period of imperial rule it was left out of most major wars, so it could develop new technology in peace. Because of this, the re-introduction of Germany (along with its new technology and arcana) into [[Aareth/Places/Celestial Bodies/Aareth/Afro-Eurasia/Eurasia/Europe/Europe\|Europe]] after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire was one of the most world-changing events of the time. 

# Place in Society
Sitting in a populated area of the [[Aareth/Places/Celestial Bodies/Aareth/Aareth\|world]] and known for its advanced technology and magic, Germany -in particular its capital [[Aareth/Countries/Germany/Berlin/Berlin\|Berlin]]- is known as a hub of thinking and commerce, a place for exchange of goods and ideas. While not one of the leading powers in the world for its lack of a strong military, Germany is at the forefront of a lot of scientific research, and specializes in Illusion magic.

# Culture
Germans are serious, efficient folk, much like the stereotypical German of Earth.

# Government and Elections
Germany is a mostly representative democracy. Each voter selects one candidate for their district, and the winner holds the title of Representative. Additionally, each voter selects a district other than their own- the representative from this district holds the title of Representative for Germany, and acts as an executive whose primary purpose is to take on extra power in times of war. These representatives make up the entirety of nationally elected government and hold a similar position to that of the American congress, making laws, designing a budget, and negotiating war and peace. To show proof of identity in this society where recognition by face is a heavily flawed method, each voter, either at the time of their birth in the case of citizens or during the process of immigration in the case of noncitizen voters, is issued a medallion with their name on it. This medallion is magically "stamped" after being presented to election officials to ensure that each individual only votes once. Elections are open for one [[Aareth/History/Timekeeping/Weeks/Standard Week\|tenday]], from the beginning of [[Aareth/History/Timekeeping/Weeks/Primay\|Primay]] to the end of [[Aareth/History/Timekeeping/Weeks/Termay\|Termay]].
