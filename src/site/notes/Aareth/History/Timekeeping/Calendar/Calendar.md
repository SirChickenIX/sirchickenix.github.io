# Calendar
The **Calendar** of [[Aareth/Places/Celestial Bodies/Aareth/Aareth\|Aareth]] is broken up into twelve months of thirty days each. There is also a mini-month, [[Festival\|Festival]], in the middle of the year that is five days long. [[Aareth/History/Timekeeping/Weeks/Standard Week\|Weeks]] are ten days long. Each month has three weeks, and the beginning of each month starts a new week. There is also a leap day (January 0) every four years, called Newfour.

Years are counted since the start of the most recent Age. The current Age is the [[Aareth/History/Events/Eras/Age of Connection\|Age of Connection]], which started 237 years ago. The current date (the end of Campaign #1 led by Wyatt) is June 01, 237 A.C.. 

# History
The current calendar system was started on January 0, 0 by the [[Aareth/History/Events/Great Treaty\|Great Treaty]]. It is the first calendar to be used by the entire world.
